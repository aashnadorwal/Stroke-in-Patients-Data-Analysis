## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing patient data to explore patterns related to stroke occurrences. The dataset includes patient attributes such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, BMI, and glucose levels. The goal is to identify correlations between these factors and the likelihood of having a stroke through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Dataset
It includes the following key features:

- **gender:** Patient's gender
- **age:** Patient's age
- **hypertension:** Hypertension condition (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **heart_disease:** Presence of heart disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **smoking_status:** Patient's smoking history (e.g., never smoked, formerly smoked, etc.)
- **avg_glucose_level:** Average glucose level in the blood
- **bmi:** Body Mass Index
- **stroke:** Whether the patient experienced a stroke (1 = Yes, 0 = No)


## Usage

Key Questions Addressed:

1. Which gender has a higher susceptibility to strokes?
2. Is there a higher likelihood of stroke due to smoking?
3. Do individuals living in different residence types (Urban vs. Rural) have different rates of strokes?
4. How does stroke rate vary by age and residence type?


## Libraries Used

- **pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib:** Data visualization.
